Hey there everyone its been soo nice learing CSS 
This is my another contribution in my web devlopment journey...
I always wanted to make a nice looking website specifically parallax and co-incidentely my web dev course covers it 

In this Repo theres a HTML file and another is css it is a parallax website 
for those who dont know,
parallax is a type of webite in which several images are stacked onto each other wherein foreground images have more scrolling speed than the background images 
which makes really nice looking visual called as parallax 

Thanks for visiting...
